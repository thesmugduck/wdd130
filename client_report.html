        <h2>Final Project Report</h2>

        <h3>Client Report</h3>
        <p>For my website I reviewed horror movies that I have seen and found some fun collage images that related to
            popular horror movies. I mainly used email for communicating with the team, I didn't have to do much with
            that however. The Lead dev did not quite complete the homepage but I really loved the subpages. Next time I
            think I need to communicate more with the lead dev and set up a better system besides email.</p>

        <h3>Lead Dev Report</h3>
        <p>For the Lead dev position I used email to communicate the site plan. With the client I talked in person with
            and figured out more of what was expected and tried my best to fulfil his requests. I sent his website url
            through email and published it on GitHub. GitHub was very confusing at first but I think I was able to
            handle the basics. I'm still a little confused by it all.</p>

        <h3>Jr. Dev Report</h3>
        <p>I think I had a better experience as a Jr. dev. I was able to set up a messaging group chat with one of the
            teams and there was a better line of communication with that. I was able to contribute at least a little bit
            to the sites and I knew which pages I was doing. I didn't have any issues with adding changes through GitHub
            which I'm thankful for.</p>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>I think the most challenging part of this project was that we were all thrown together into 4 different
            groups at the same time. And it was hard to keep track of everyone and what I was supposed to be doing. The
            communication was terrible. If I could go back and do things differently I would set up group chats for
            every team and use phone numbers instead of email. I did enjoy seeing all of the projects come to life and
            my site being made. I feel a lot more comfortable with working on a real life senario now because I know how
            to improve and I know a lot more about GitHub.</p>
